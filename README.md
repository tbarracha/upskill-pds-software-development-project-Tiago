 Principles of software development project - client use case and implementation

### Preamble
This project presents a (simulated) context in which DGS, a state-funded Portuguese healthcare
system, intends to explore and validate an application to manage the Covid-19 vaccination process.
To this end, the company decided to start the development of a new software product (prototype) in
collaboration with the students of the UPskill program.

### Intended Software Product
DGS is a state-funded Portuguese healthcare system that wants an application to manage the Covid-19
vaccination process, in Portugal. As Coronavirus might not be the last pandemic in our lifetime, the
application should be designed to easily support managing other future pandemic events requiring a
massive vaccination of the population. The software application should also be conceived having in
mind that it can be further commercialized to other companies and/or organizations and/or
healthcare systems besides DGS.
