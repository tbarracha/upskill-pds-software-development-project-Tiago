| **Vaccine administration process** | The SNS user schedules the vaccination by issuing a vaccination appointment. Then, the application should check the vaccination center capacity for that day/time and, if possible, confirm that the vaccination is scheduled and inform the user that he/she should be at the selected vaccination center at the scheduled day and time. Some users (e.g., older ones) may want to go to a healthcare center to schedule the vaccine appointment with the help of a receptionist.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |

| **Vaccine Technology**             | Ever since the first vaccine was developed in 1796 to treat smallpox,1 several different methods have been created to develop successful vaccines.<br/>Today, those methods, known as vaccine technologies, are more advanced and use the latest technology to help protect the world from preventable diseases.<br/>Depending on the pathogen (a bacteria or virus) that is being targeted, different vaccine technologies are used to generate an effective vaccine.<br/>ust like there are multiple ways to develop a vaccine, they can also take on multiple forms—from needle injections and nasal sprays to oral doses, a more recent innovation.<br/> In total, there are six different vaccine technology platforms, each with its own benefits, and examples.<br/> The full specification can be obtained from https://www.pfizer.com/news/articles/understanding_six_types_of_vaccine_technologies. |
| **Vaccination appointment**        | The SNS user schedules the vaccination, selecting the vaccination centre, the timestamp and the type of vaccine to be administered.
